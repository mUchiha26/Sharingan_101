# ࿋ Sharingan

**AI-Powered Cybersecurity Red Team Assistant**

---

## Overview

**Sharingan** is an AI-assisted cybersecurity tool that supports **red team operations** by automating repetitive and traditional tasks such as reconnaissance, basic enumeration, and OSINT aggregation.

The project’s primary objective is **learning by practice**: understanding how offensive security workflows are structured, how tools are orchestrated, and how AI can assist analysis and reporting—while keeping the human operator fully in control.

Sharingan follows a **progressive development model**, starting with a basic and transparent version (V1) and evolving toward more advanced capabilities over time.

## Project Goals

- Automate repetitive red-team tasks  
- Centralize and normalize tool outputs  
- Assist analysis and reporting using AI  
- Improve focus on strategy and decision-making  
- Learn offensive security methodologies through implementation  

> ⚠️ Sharingan is not an autonomous hacking system.  
> Human validation is required at every stage.
